          "raw": "\n# Prologue\n\nAs of June 11th 2023, I mainly work on maintaining these projects:\n\n-  [davidilie.com](https://github.com/davidilie/davidilie.com) - This website you are reading this post from.\n-  [personal-dashboard](https://github.com/davidilie/personal-dashboard) - Personal dashboard containing my services and the news.\n-  [home-cluster](https://github.com/davidilie/home-cluster) - Infastrure-as-code repository for my home Kubernetes cluster.\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you check out all these projects ([and all my others](https://github.com/davidilie)) and star them!\n\nI might make a unique blog posts regarding each project but for now I want to tell you about `personal-dashboard`, and how showcasing this project to Reddit gave a \"boost\" to my projects.\n\n# What is personal-dashboard?\n\nLike most Homelab-ers, we like to keep track of all the services we host at home through bookmarks in our browser or a dashboard.\n\nFrankly, there are already many different dashboards that I could've chosen from but all of them had their quirks and I reached the same conlcusion I always reach in occassions like these:\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤔\" italic>\n   I'll just make my own! I mean, it can't be that hard, right?\n</Callout>\n\nJokes aside, I created the `v1` of this dashboard in July and just started using it in my day-to-day workloads, and it worked great!\n\nAfter I got it working, I decided to take a month-long break to work on [sharex-upload-server](https://github.com/davidilie/sharex-upload-server). Once that project slowed down, I decided to re-visit the month-old codebase and start working on it again. Like most developers, month-old code can be considered obselete by some people (including myself) so I rewrote most of the logic to my highest standard.\n\n# Posting to Reddit\n\nOn my way to school I mainly browse Reddit on my phone, and that time I was browsing through [r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted) and discovered an interesting section called \"Personal Dashboard\", and what I saw amazed me:\n\nMost of the dashboards were either [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) or [Heimdall](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall)\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🖥️\">\n   Both of them are great dashboards that I have used in the past.\n</Callout>\n\nBut my amazement revoled around the fact that many people post their own dashboard, but the only uniqueness of all these posts are the services that they run, not the software itself. This is where an idea sprung up in my head:\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤔\" italic>\n   What if I post my own dashboard, it might get more attention due to its\n   uniqueness!\n</Callout>\n\n... and that is what I did! That night, I quickly wrote up my first ever (**proper**) reddit post which contained a video showing my dashboard in action, and a short paragraph containing the backstory in the comments.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/first-reddit-post/self-hosted-comment.png\"\n   width={924}\n   height={343}\n/>\n\nWith that done, I went to bed, hoping to get around 50 upvotes and a couple of comments. But little did I know, those values were multipled by two throughout the next 24 hours...\n\n# 300 upvotes! What?\n\nThat's exactly my reaction when I opened my phone, that day I was at the very top of [r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted)!\n\nI also started looking at the comments, and I'll let you see them for yourself. Here are some highlights:\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤯\" italic>\n   15 years? God damn, good job. - MagellanCl\n</Callout>\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🙄\" italic>\n   Well I'm 23 and a graduated software developer. I'm jealous of your skills.\n   Very nice work there. - lililomgo\n</Callout>\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🚀\" italic>\n   David, you are going to go very far in software engineering. Keep tinkering,\n   building, and learnign! - rgthree\n</Callout>\n\nAnd many more... I really enjoyed reading all your comments, it was a good way to start my day!\n\n# Next up, my GitHub profile\n\nBefore this, I had a pretty generic GitHub profile. A couple of stars here and there throughout my projects and a couple of followers. Pretty generic.\n\nNow, let's take a look at my 4 projects that I mentioned earlier, after 24 hours.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/first-reddit-post/pinned-repos.png\"\n   width={923}\n   height={269}\n   alt=\"My pinned projects.\"\n/>\n\n68 stars?! That's insanse! I never thought people would access the repository and my GitHub profile. The other interesting part is that my other projects started getting stars as well, which sprung a high smile on my face :)\n\nIn addition, my GitHub profile starting getting some new followers which overall made by GitHub profile grow **alot**.\n\n# Website analytics\n\nIn my opinion, seeing analytics is one of the most interesting parts of web development. As it can allow you to the most visisted places of your page and also see the parts you might need to improve.\n\nWhen I built my website, I discovered [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) which is by default a paid software, but it's free to use if you can self-host it yourself, so I spinned up a virtual machine and followed their `docker-compose` guide:\n\n<GitHubRepository username=\"plausible\" repo=\"hosting\" />\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🙏🏻\">\n   I've now created my own deployment of Plausible on my [home\n   cluster](https://github.com/DavidIlie/home-cluster/tree/main/kubernetes/apps/default/plausible/app)\n</Callout>\n\nTo then integrate it in any `Next.js` application, you can install the [next-plausible](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-plausible) package and then add this JSX code to your `_app.tsx`:\n\n```tsx title=\"Plausible _app.tsx example\"\n<PlausibleProvider\n   domain=\"davidilie.com\"\n   selfHosted\n   trackOutboundLinks\n   enabled={true}\n   customDomain={\"https://stats.davidilie.com\"}\n>\n   *page content*\n</PlausibleProvider>\n```\n\nIn that same information comment, I included a link to my website as well, so some people decided to visit my website as well. Let's take a look...\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/first-reddit-post/plausible_website_stats.png\"\n   width={400}\n   height={115}\n   className=\"mx-auto\"\n   alt=\"The amount of unique visits in the last 24 hours.\"\n/>\n\nI never thought a basic portfolio website would recieve so many visits! Let's take a closer look.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/first-reddit-post/more_stats_plausible.png\"\n   width={1452}\n   height={321}\n   alt=\"The statistics from October 1st to 3rd.\"\n/>\n\nInitially, I thought that all these visitors would only be looking at my website for a couple of seconds, but I was completely wrong! 5+ minutes is extremely good for a basic portfolio website!\n\n# I am on hacker news!\n\nPlausible also allows me to see from which pages some requests come from:\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/first-reddit-post/visited_pages_plausible.png\"\n   width={1436}\n   height={970}\n   alt=\"The visits from October 1st to 3rd.\"\n/>\n\nThat's when I noticed that [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28728640) is my third source of visits between those 3 days. I never expected for someone to post my [pfSense post](https://davidilie.com/blog/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense) there, and for people to click it as well!\n\n<Callout italic>\n   Pretty interesting article, especially for a 15 year old. I ran across his\n   site while perusing /r/selfhosted and saw his custom dashboard he made. -\n   mattr47\n</Callout>\n\n# What's next?\n\nMany people commented that they would like to see a customizable version which anyone can self-host, as currently it's restricted to only my pinned services.\n\n<Callout italic>\n   Already looking forward to it being customizable! - This seems to really fill\n   the gap. - 2relativ\n</Callout>\n\nI've started work on a new update for the dashboard and once it's done I'll update this post with what happens. You can check out the repo here:\n\n<GitHubRepository repo=\"personal-dashboard\" />\n\n# The mistakes\n\nQuickly after the post was published, some comments started to flow in regarding keeping my domains for my services public:\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤓\" italic>\n   Be careful with those public domains. Ensure they’re secure, and I’m not sure\n   I’d recommend posting them publicly on Reddit. - Azurnear\n</Callout>\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤓\" italic>\n   But please (as the others pointed out), be careful with the exposed domains\n   :) - dougmaitelli\n</Callout>\n\nTo combat this I mentioned that I am using [Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia) to protect most of my services on the internet. To see how you can set this up for yourself, check out my [guide here](https://github.com/DavidIlie/kubernetes-setup/tree/master/8%20-%20authelia).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall this weekend was really fun, at one point I could refresh the page and get one or two more upvotes each refresh. As I am writing this now, the increase in upvotes has become much slower and will become more slower in the future.\n\nWhen I would post something like this again, I'll make sure to be careful next time I do this so that I won't risk my services or other stuff.\n\nHope you enjoyed this different kind of post, have a good rest of your day!\n\nCheers!\n",

          "raw": "\n# The problem\n\nWhile working on one of my projects ([sharex-upload-server](https://github.com/davidilie/sharex-upload-server)) I came across a problem with fetching data such as settings from my backend. The problem was that I didn't want to do the request on **every** request, just in the moments where I wanted it to be fetched (such as updating the profile or force-reload).\n\nFurthermore, if you have a deep component structure, and need to fetch the same data in more than one component, you would essentially be making the same request many times in the same page to access the data (I know props are a thing, but it's annoying to persist in a deep-component structure).\n\n```tsx title=\"Example\"\nconst { isLoading, data: isLoggedIn } = useQuery(\"/api/user\");\n\nreturn isLoading ? <Loader /> : <Website />;\n\n// this would need to be repeated for every component which would need this data\n```\n\nIt's also common practice that you should cut down on requests as much as possible. To keep a stable performance both in the frontend and backend. So I knew that I had to find a better solution to solve this problem.\n\n# The Stack\n\nBefore I talk about the solution, you first need to understand the stack I used to build this project:\n\n-  Express.js Server\n   -  Typescript\n   -  TypeORM\n   -  MongoDB\n-  Next.js Frontend\n   -  Typescript\n   -  Tailwind CSS\n   -  react-query\n\n<Callout>This is now going to be my go-to stack for future projects :)</Callout>\n\n# The old system\n\nI mentioned in one of my previous blog posts that I love [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which one of its main features is that it uses SSR by default; allowing me to use `getServerSideProps` to make requests before the page actually loads, preventing the need for nested if statements checking if my `isLoggedIn` requests have gone through (see example above).\n\n```tsx\nexport const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async ({ req, res }) => {\n   const user = await loginCheckAndGetUser(req, res);\n   return {\n      props: user,\n   };\n};\n```\n\n(I still use this system for every page today, but I **only** check if the user is not logged in, nothing else)\n\nI also have a `getInitialProps` function running on `_app.tsx` which fetches the settings for my website:\n\n```tsx\nApp.getInitialProps = async () => {\n   const settingsRequest = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/api/settings`);\n   const settingsResponse = await settingsRequest.json();\n\n   return { settings: settingsResponse };\n};\n```\n\nThe problem with this was that in order to get the settings returned to a component such as my navigation bar, I would need to nest the data through props which complicated my component structure too much, so I knew I had to find a better approach to this...\n\n# The new system\n\nI initially thought I could implement a system using React Context but I quickly came to the conclusion that React Context is too complicated to do something as simple as this.\n\nThat's when I started looking into other, more _basic_, state management libraries which is when I discovered [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) which is a very intuitive state management library which let's me do exactly what I want:\n\n-  Define my state once and then set it whenever I want\n-  Be able to update it whenever I want\n\nFirst you need to install [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand):\n\n```bash\nyarn add zustand\n```\n\nAfterwards you can create a \"store\" for your data:\n\n```ts\nimport { SettingsType } from \"@sharex-server/common\";\nimport create from \"zustand\";\n\ntype Store = {\n   settings: SettingsType;\n   updateSettings: (settings: SettingsType) => void;\n};\n\nexport const useSettingsStore = create<Store>((set) => ({\n   settings: {} as SettingsType,\n   updateSettings(settings: SettingsType) {\n      set((state) => ({\n         ...state,\n         settings: settings,\n      }));\n   },\n}));\n```\n\n<Callout>\n   Notice how I created a updateSettings function, we will use this later.\n</Callout>\n\nAfterwards we need to add some custom code in the `_app.tsx` to do the following:\n\n-  Prevent loading any JSX before all the data in our stores is defined\n-  Make data fetch on load via useEffect\n-  Make data only refetch when the page is force-reloaded\n\nTo do that, we first define a local state to check if all the data has been loaded:\n\n```tsx\nconst [finishedDataCheck, setFinishedDataCheck] = useState<boolean>(false);\n```\n\nThen we create a check to not return any JSX if finishedDataCheck is false:\n\n```tsx\nif (!finishedSettingsCheck) {\n   return null;\n}\n```\n\nAfterwards we create a useEffect hook which complies with the 3 points I mentioned earlier:\n\n```tsx\nconst { settings, updateSettings } = useSettingsStore((s) => s);\nconst { user, updateUser } = useUserStore();\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n   if (performance.navigation.type != 1) {\n      if (settings.name && user.name) return setFinishedDataCheck(true);\n   }\n   const getData = async () => {\n      const settings = await getSettingsData();\n      const user = await getUserData();\n      updateSettings(settings);\n      updateUser(user);\n      setFinishedDataCheck(true);\n   };\n   getData();\n}, []);\n```\n\nWith that done, we can now create a custom hook which we can use in any page, **any time**:\n\n```ts\nimport { useSettingsStore } from \"@global-stores/useSettingsStore\";\n\nexport default function useSettings() {\n   const settings = useSettingsStore((s) => s.settings);\n\n   return settings;\n}\n```\n\n# Using it in components\n\nNow, any time I want, I can use this hook to fetch my data and I won't need any `isLoading` if statements or risk it being undefined (unless the server is offline :p)\n\n```ts\nconst settings = useSettings();\n```\n\n## Updating the store with new data\n\nOne of my goals was to also be able to update the data whenever I want, and then have the information updated everywhere around the page. Courtesy of the `updateSettings` function this is really easy.\n\nTake a look at this function, I first import the store (without the hook) so that I have access to the update function:\n\n```tsx\nconst { user, updateUser } = useUserStore();\n```\n\nNow, we can actually use the function:\n\n```tsx\nonSubmit={async (data, { setSubmitting }) => {\n    setSubmitting(true);\n\n    try {\n        const r = await axios.post(\n            `${api_url}/api/user/profile`,\n            data\n        );\n        const response = await r.data;\n\n        if (r.status === 200) {\n            toast.success(\"Updated successfully!\");\n            updateUser(response);\n            setSubmitting(true);\n        } else {\n            toast.error(response.message);\n        }\n    } catch (error: any) {\n        toast.error(error.message);\n    }\n}}\n```\n\nThis is part of a formik form which send a post request containing the updated data to my server, and then updates the store via the `updateUser` function.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nNice! I finally got this system working and it can actually be used in other projects in the future and removes the bottleneck of useless server requests, `isLoading` statements everywhere, etc.\n\nHope this guide/rant has been helpful, if you want to check out the rest of the code for this project, here it is below.\n\n<GitHubRepository repo=\"sharex-upload-server\" />\n\nAnyways, have a good rest of your day!\n\nCheers!\n",

If you don't want to read the post, you can watch the video here:\n\n<YouTubeVideo url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwNfNV2neVc\" />\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe internet, some of us use it for consuming content, some of us use it for basic business duties and then people such as myself provide services for the other two by means of programming. Nonetheless, technology has empowered us with the opportunity to have access to the internet at our fingertips, and to the comfort of our homes via our montly subscription to access the internet.\n\nOkay okay, no more cheesy introductions. Let’s get straight to the point. I’m pretty sure you’ve all seen this little guy around your house somewhere.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/ont-router.jpg\"\n   alt=\"The standard home-router.\"\n   width={800}\n   height={800}\n/>\n\nThe proper term for these guys is an ONT/Router which most of the time means:\n\n-  It act as a modem (allowing you to connect your network to the outer-world via a fiber-optic-cable)\n-  It act as a router (allowing you to connect home devices to your network and let them communicate with each other)\n-  Finally, it provides a Wi-Fi access point to you and your family.\n\nFor most people this device would be great, and it is! That’s why so many ISPs prefer to give one of these multipurpose devices instead of 3 different devices.\n\n# The Idea\n\nHowever, if you’re more technical, and have 3 servers in your attic, it can get really annoying that some of the options on your router's interface (such as preferred DNS servers, etc) are blocked by default to prevent you from bricking your entire home network, which I’ve done in the past.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/home-cluster.png\"\n   alt=\"My home infastructure.\"\n   width={1295}\n   height={410}\n/>\n\n# The problem\n\nFor the past month now, I’ve been having issues with my internet connection where it would work fine for a couple of days, and then randomly would just stop working. And I mean completely, dead. Sometimes I would be able to load one web page but then have to wait an obscene amount of time for the page to load, but most of the time it just times out. The last time it happened, I managed to run some tests in my network and saw that for every 10 packets that would be sent out from my router, 5 of them would be lost, which means a 50% packet loss!\n\nObviously I was annoyed and every time this happened, I would ring up my ISP, and here is what they would say most of the time:\n\n<Callout italic>\n   \"Unfortunately sir, there is a major problem with our line in your area.\n   Please wait a couple of hours and it should come back.\"\n</Callout>\n\nIn those cases I just waited it out and then, low and behold, my internet would come back! However, I was working on my computer and this problem happened again, I thought it might have been another outage, so I decided to call them to check:\n\n<Callout italic>\n   \"Currently there are no reported outages in your area, I will have to run\n   some more tests but it looks like the latency is too high and most requests\n   time out.\"\n</Callout>\n\nLatency is the problem?! I knew it. I ran some tests and saw that there was a 50% packet loss which must mean there is a problem with my router, or the system on the other end, as later in the call they clarified that the fiber connection is stable.\n\n## Monitoring the problem\n\nAbout 7 days ago, I set up a simple raspberry pi with a couple of docker containers monitoring my internet connection by running a speedtest every 30 minutes, and then displaying it in a nice Grafana dashboard, and this is where I saw the real problem.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/monitoring-pi.png\"\n   alt=\"Custom Grafana dashboard with metrics.\"\n   width={806}\n   height={683}\n/>\n\nLooking at these two points, we can see that there are moments where my speed goes relatively lower than normal. In addition, I looked at my router's metrics and thought about this:\n\nWhat if my router is running out of resources because:\n\n-  30 Wi-Fi Clients\n-  40 Wired Devices\n\nConsidering this, a basic home network wouldn't have this many devices flowing through it, so I knew the problem might be that the router is too weak to handle all of this load, and I do have about 150GB of ram and 16 cores lying around unused in my server…\n\n<Callout emoji=\"🤔\">\n   Okay, a router doesn’t really need that much resources but this did give me\n   an idea. My current router is like a pet, it's restricted by default, really\n   simple, and a lot of maintenance is required when something goes wrong.\n   However, if I build the router myself, and use highly documented software, I\n   can freely configure any part of the router to my needs, and have it be part\n   of my cattle infrastructure.\n</Callout>\n\n# The new system\n\nWhen I bought Nucleus, I specifically made sure that 2 of the 4 ethernet ports in the server can be passed through to a virtual machine, and I already have a pfsense virtual machine created from a couple of months back.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/iommu-pci-device.png\"\n   alt=\"IOMMU passthrough in Proxmox.\"\n   width={432}\n   height={201}\n/>\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nThere are two _well-known_ ways to accomplish a setup like this:\n\n-  Connect fiber-optic cable directly to the VM\n-  Change router to bridge mode to connect to VM (This is the one I will talk about)\n\n<Callout>\n   Bridge mode disables the built-in router and Wi-Fi portions and only leaves\n   the modem, exposing the connection to any ethernet port on the router which\n   can be plugged in to another router.\n</Callout>\n\nGetting a router into bridge mode can be relatively differnet so I won't tell you how to do it. But if you can't see it in your router's web page or you can't modifiy it, you can call your ISP like I did.\n\nIn my case, they immediately put my router in bridge mode, meaning I lost access to the internet.\n\n# Connecting the WAN and LAN ports\n\nWhen my ISP routed my fiber cable a year ago, they decided to put it under my desk, which is not very useful when my server is in my attic. Thankfully, I already had an ethernet cable going up there for my servers so I decided to re-use that one.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/server-wan-lan.jpg\"\n   alt=\"My WAN and LAN cables connected to my server.\"\n   width={1448}\n   height={1086}\n/>\n\nYes, my servers are sitting on a box. Don't make fun of me!\n\nThen you need to connect the LAN cable to your main switch so that other clients can connect to pfSense's LAN.\n\n<Image\n   src=\"/content/replace-your-home-router-with-pfsense/home-switch.jpg\"\n   alt={`My \"main\" switch connecting my home to the internet.`}\n   width={1448}\n   height={1086}\n/>\n\nWith that done, we can then pass through those two ports to the virtual machine and start the VM!\n\n# Configuring the Virtual Machine\n\nThere is not much that I can show you as it would\n\n-  Show private information about my server\n-  Every setup is different!\n   -  My configuration might not work for you!\n\nBecause of this, I recommend you to follow some tutorials online to get your router configured. I recommend this video below by [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck) as it clearly shows how to configure pfSense to your needs.\n\n<YouTubeVideo url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUzSsX4T4WQ\" />\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy fully taking control of your router, it enables more capabilities than what you had before (granted, there are now risks of bricking your internet). Here are some key things I did to my pfSense install to protect my home network\n\n-  You can change default DNS servers to anything you want (like Pi-Hole)\n-  You can install custom plugins\n   -  Run your own VPN instead of running it inside your network\n-  You can add custom firewalls is required for things like port forwarding\n\nand so much more...\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoyed this blog post. I also will start making blog posts for every single video that I post, so that you can have a readable version of my video.\n",
