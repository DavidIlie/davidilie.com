# Intro

Back when I wrote this website throughout the 2021 summer, The principle was more oriented to my previous "microservice" arhitecture instead of a more practical approach like now. I still find the idea interesting, but I personally think for a portfolio website it is not needed, and with `Next.js`'s amazing featureset, I can do everything that I need from the same `Next.js` app!

This part year I've spent a lot of time experimenting with different/new approaches to creating web applications and I've made many projects which you can see on my [GitHub](https://github.com/davidilie).

# The Old Design

The project was structured as a <Definition term="monorepo" definition="A repository which contains more than one project"/> with these packages:

-  `frontend` - `Next.js` frontend
-  `agenda` - Background Services
-  `identify` - Auth server for `agenda`
-  `spotify` - Spotify statistics

<InfoQuote>
   This was back before I didn't know how to actually create a monorepo, so each
   folder had its own "node_modules", etc...
</InfoQuote>

What's even more funny is that the entire project has been converted to Typescript except for the `agenda` microservice as even while I was coding it I didn't really understand how it worked so therefore i didn't want to touch it :)

By having everything so seperate from each other, it was hard to keep everything synced with each other (Type Definitions, etc.) so I left most types for API responses as `any` which is never good for a _senior professional typescript mastermind_ like how I am now.
