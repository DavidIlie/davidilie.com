                I'm David, a 14 year old software developer directing my focus
                into web development. I've been interested into any kinds of
                technology since I was little. I don't know how I got into it,
                it could have been my father's career, or my discovery of the
                huge world which is the internet, but nonetheless, I am proud
                that I am pursuing a subject that can be used in as much ways as
                possible to help others.
