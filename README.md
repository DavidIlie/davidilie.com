# Personal Website

This repository is home to my [website's](https://davidilie.com) code.

The website itself uses [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) along with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and it is place to show of my projects and my discoveries. The core structure of the website is somewhat finished but there are lots of changes that I want to do in the future.

## Structure

## Contributions

This repository is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue so that it can be neatly organised and prevent duplicates.
